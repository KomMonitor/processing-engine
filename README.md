# KomMonitor Script Execution REST API

## Overview
This API aims to provide REST API functions to trigger and query process execution via so called jobs that shall be executed asynchronously.
It will be used as part of the KomMonitor project.

More info will be added on time.

## INDICATOR SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT
Complex indicators can be automatically computed by the use of custom Javascipt scripts. New scripts are based on a TEMPLATE script file. For more information about the template and the process to add/write new scripts please visit the respective documentation at [test](/resources/README.md).  

## Third Party Dependencies
We use [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker) to gain insight about used third party libs. I.e. install globally via ```npm install -g license-checker```, navigate to root of the project and then perform ```license-checker --json --out ThirdParty.json``` to create/overwrite the respective file in JSON format.
